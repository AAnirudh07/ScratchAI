## Creating an issue

## Submitting a pull request

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

* For a new feature or function, please create an issue first to discuss it with us before submitting a pull request.
* Keep your change as focused as possible.
  * If there are changes in multiple directories you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, please submit them as separate pull requests.
* The pull request should have a useful title and description.
